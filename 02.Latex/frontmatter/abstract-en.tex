\textbf{(Summary)}

\hspace{1em}Image recognition technology using deep learning has rapidly advanced in recent years. However, cat image recognition faces challenges due to the diversity of fur patterns and postural variations. Existing general-purpose image recognition models cannot adequately address these cat-specific challenges, with individual cat identification accuracy reported at approximately 80\%.

\hspace{1em}This study aims to: (1) systematically review existing methods related to cat image recognition to clarify current challenges and research gaps; and (2) design, implement, and evaluate a novel neural network architecture ``NekoNet'' that leverages cat-specific morphological features, using a systems engineering approach based on ISO 15288.

\hspace{1em}A systematic literature review (SLR) extracted and classified 42 cat-related methods from 417 papers. Analysis revealed that most existing methods do not utilize cat-specific morphological features and exhibit significant accuracy-speed trade-offs. To address this challenge, we designed the Neko Attention Module focusing on morphological features of cat ears, eyes, and tails, and implemented the lightweight NekoNet architecture based on MobileNetV3. Evaluation experiments demonstrated that the proposed method achieved 92.6\% recognition accuracy (mAP@0.5) and 48 FPS processing speed, significantly outperforming conventional methods (YOLOv8-nano, MobileNet-SSD, EfficientDet-D0).

\hspace{1em}This study contributes to the systematization of morphological features in cat image recognition and the establishment of efficient recognition methods utilizing these features.
